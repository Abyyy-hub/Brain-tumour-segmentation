Brain Tumor Segmentation with Computer Vision

Objective:
Automate the detection and segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans using image processing and machine learning, streamlining the diagnostic workflow for healthcare professionals.

Key Features:

* Automated MRI Processing: Ingests brain MRI images and identifies tumor regions.
* Modular Pipeline:

   Preprocessing (grayscale, denoising, contrast enhancement)
   Feature extraction (edge detection, morphological operations)
   Tumor segmentation (thresholding, contour detection, optional deep learning with U-Net)
* Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for uploading scans and visualizing results in real-time.
* Deployment Ready: Lightweight, browser-accessible application for clinical use or demonstration.

Tech Stack:

* Languages: Python
* Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
* Framework: Streamlit
* Optional Models: TensorFlow/Keras for CNN-based segmentation

Outcomes & Learning:

* Gained hands-on experience in medical image segmentation and preprocessing.
* Developed a full-stack computer vision application for healthcare.
* Learned to bridge image analysis with user-centered design for medical tools.

Industry Application:

* Domain: Healthcare, Radiology, Medical Imaging
* Supports radiologists with faster, more accurate tumor identification.
* A step toward AI-assisted diagnostics in clinical environments.
